# Image-Process-Robot-with-OpenCV2
The project involves controlling a robot with only horizontal movement using a remote control to track and avoid certain colored lights, while the robot processes images with a camera mounted on it to accumulate high scores. The robot is situated at the beginning of a 5-lane LED plane. Two different colored LED lights on each lane, according to the game rules, move towards the side where the robot is located. When the robot aligns with one of the colors and the LED light in front of it is of that color, it earns +2 points. On the other hand, if the LED light in front of the robot is of the other color, the robot loses 1 point. The robot can process images through the camera attached to its arm. The aim of the robot is to achieve the highest possible score.
